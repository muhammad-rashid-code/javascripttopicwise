//In JavaScript, a do...while loop is similar to a while loop, but with one important difference: the code block inside the do...while loop is executed at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

//The basic syntax of a do...while loop in JavaScript is as follows:

//do {
    // code block to be executed
  //} while (condition);

  //Here's an example of a do...while loop that prompts the user for a number and continues to prompt until a valid number is entered:

//   let num;
// do {
//   num = prompt("Enter a number:");
// } while (isNaN(num));
// console.log("You entered the number " + num);

// In JavaScript, a do...while loop is similar to a while loop, but with one important difference: the code block inside the do...while loop is executed at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

// The basic syntax of a do...while loop in JavaScript is as follows:

// javascript
// Copy code
// do {
//   // code block to be executed
// } while (condition);
// Here's an example of a do...while loop that prompts the user for a number and continues to prompt until a valid number is entered:

// javascript
// Copy code
// let num;
// do {
//   num = prompt("Enter a number:");
// } while (isNaN(num));
// console.log("You entered the number " + num);
// In this example, the code block inside the do statement prompts the user to enter a number using the prompt() function, and then assigns the value to the num variable. The isNaN() function is used to check if the value of num is not a number. If num is not a number, the loop will execute again, prompting the user to enter another value. This process will continue until a valid number is entered.

// Because the do...while loop executes the code block at least once before checking the condition, the prompt will always be displayed at least once, even if the user enters a valid number on the first try.

// It's important to note that just like with a while loop, a do...while loop can also result in an infinite loop if the condition is never met. Therefore, it's important to include a way to exit the loop if the condition is never met
