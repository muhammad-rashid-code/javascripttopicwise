// In JavaScript, you can pass data to a function as arguments when you call it. To pass data, you simply include the values as comma-separated arguments in the function call.

// For example, consider the following function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
function addNumbers(num1,num2){
    return num1 + num2
}
// //To pass data to this function, you can call it with two arguments:
// let result=addNumbers(5,7);
// console.log(result);//Output:12
// // In the above example, the addNumbers function is called with arguments 5 and 7. The function adds these two numbers and returns the result, which is then stored in the result variable. Finally, the result is printed to the console.

// // You can pass any type of data to a JavaScript function, including numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and even other functions.

// // It's important to note that when you pass an argument to a function, JavaScript makes a copy of the value of the argument and passes it to the function. This means that if you change the value of the argument inside the function, it does not affect the original value outside of the function.
