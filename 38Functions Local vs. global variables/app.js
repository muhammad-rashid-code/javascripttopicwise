// In JavaScript, variables can be either local or global depending on where they are defined.

// Local variables are defined inside a function using the let or const keyword and are only accessible within that function. Local variables have a scope that is limited to the function in which they are defined. For example:
// function myFuntion(){
//     let myVariable="I am a local variable"
//     console.log(myVariable);
// }
// myFuntion();// Output: "I am a local variable"
// console.log(myVariable);// Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: myVariable is not defined
// In the example above, myVariable is a local variable defined inside the myFunction() function using the let keyword. This variable can only be accessed within the function.

//Global variables, on the other hand, are defined outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the code, including inside functions. Global variables have a scope that extends to the entire program. For example:
// let myGlobalVariable="i am aglobal variable"
// function myFunction(){
//     console.log(myGlobalVariable);
// }
// myFunction();// Output: "I am a global variable"
// console.log(myGlobalVariable);// Output: "I am a global variable"

// // In this example, myGlobalVariable is a global variable defined outside the myFunction() function. This variable can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

// // It's important to be careful when using global variables because they can be modified from anywhere in the code, which can lead to unexpected behavior. It's generally a good practice to limit the use of global variables and instead use local variables whenever possible to avoid unintended consequences.
