//In JavaScript, there are two ways to add comments to your code:

//1.Single-line comments: To add a single-line comment, start the line with //. Anything following the // will be ignored by the JavaScript engine. For example:
// This is a single-line comment
//var x = 10; // This is another single-line comment

//2.Multi-line comments: To add a multi-line comment, enclose the comment in /* and */. Anything between the /* and */ will be ignored by the JavaScript engine. For example:

/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
//var y = 20; /* This is another multi-line comment */
//Comments are useful for documenting your code, explaining how it works, and making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain. When writing comments, it's a good idea to be concise, use proper grammar and punctuation, and avoid unnecessary or redundant comments.
